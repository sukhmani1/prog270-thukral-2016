Charlie's Prog270 Repository

Here is where I am putting some of my files from the Prog270 class


## GIT steps

- git add README.md
-  git status
- git commit -m "My Commit"
- git push

Dont ever do a git commit without the dash m(-m). It opens an editor and you wont be happy when you are in it.

## Success

I pulled my changes down in qux
