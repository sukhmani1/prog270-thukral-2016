<p>I am Sukhmani. I have spent more than 10 years writing code. I started working on HTML, CSS, Java Script then moved on to SQL and  C#. I have been exploring cloud computing for some time. I got my Salesforce Developer certification last year.

I would like to learn to write mobile applications that use cloud services. Integrating them with a legacy system. Working with mobile SDK Packs.

I like to spend time with my 3 and a half year old.</p>
